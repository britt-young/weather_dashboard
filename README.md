## Installation

A source-code editor is needed to edit/run code, I recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Usage

Users will need to register for a new API key from Open Weather Map: [API registration link](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)
After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate
Once activated, the user will need to ensure their base URL looks like the following: ``` https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key} ```
