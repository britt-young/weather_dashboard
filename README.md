## Installation
A source-code editor is needed to edit/run code, I recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Usage

Users will need to register for a new API key from Open Weather Map: [API registration link](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)
After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate
Once activated, user will need to ensure their base URL lloks like the following: ```md https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key} ```

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
    ![MOCKUP PRODUCT IMG](assets/mockup%20product.png)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
